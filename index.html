<b>
        CALL ON UMSU TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE MEETING NOW
<br>
            SIGN STUDENTS AGAINST WAR‚ÄôS REQUISITION 
<br>
The General Secretary of the University of Melbourne Student Union (UMSU) has used his power to shut down a Student General Meeting (SGM) for Palestine, requested by over 750 students, due to opposition to a motion calling for one state solution and the right of Palestinians to armed resistance. 
<br><br>
This is an attack on the democratic rights of students that needs to be fought. It is absolutely crucial that these motions are heard and passed by a Student General Meeting.
<br><br>
The Australian government could have an immediate impact by stopping the supply of armoured steel and F-35 parts directly to Israel today. But they refuse.
<br><br>
Instead, Albanese has promised to recognise a Palestinian state as a means towards achieving ‚Äúa two state solution and lasting peace.‚Äù
<br><br>
The University of Melbourne is acting in lockstep with the government in providing military aid to Israel. In 2023, Unimelb received $3.5 million from Lockheed Martin, which produces the lethal F-35 fighter jets. 
<br><br>
Unimelb also runs a joint PhD program with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI), built on occupied Palestinian land and directly integrated with the Israeli military.
<br><br>
The University and the Albanese government use the same arguments to justify their support of Israel‚Äôs genocide, arguing that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state, and that Palestinians are therefore not justified in their armed resistance of their occupation.
<br><br>
This argument has been used by the University to justify repressing student Palestine activism on campus; banning indoor protests, tracking activists‚Äô wifi usage, and suspending and expelling students. In doing so, they have relied heavily on the IHRA and Universities Australia definition of antisemitism, which equates opposition to the state of Israel with antisemitism. 
<br><br>
It has never been more crucial to puncture the lie of the two state solution and defend the right of Palestinians to resist. A Student General Meeting would make this official UMSU policy. This would spread the debate further in society and embolden all those fighting for sanctions ‚Äî at UniMelb and beyond. 
<br><br>
There is no reason to believe this can‚Äôt be done. A Student General Meeting passed motions calling for a single democratic state and the right of Palestinians to resist their occupation at Sydney Uni last year, alongside a condemnation of the Universities Australia definition of antisemitism.
<br><br>
The General Secretary is doing the dirty work of Albanese and the university administration in shutting down student‚Äôs democratic right to see these motions heard. He should be forced to argue his position in front of the 750 students who gave him this request instead of hiding behind bureaucratic maneuvers.   
<br><br>
The motions must be heard. Students should demand the SGM go ahead and prepare to walk out on September 10 when Albanese votes at the UN. Only by resisting both university management‚Äôs repression and the union bureaucracy‚Äôs conservatism can we build a student movement strong enough to win.
<br><br>
Requisition:
<br><br>
1. That the UMSU Students' Council exercise its powers to campaign against Unimelb's complicity in the genocidal onslaught in Gaza, including against Unimelb's research partnership with Lockheed Martin, and all weapons manufacturers who arm Israel‚Äôs genocide. These weapons companies profit from selling weapons to the Israeli Occupation Forces - who commit war crimes against Palestinians. Similarly, UMSU Students' Council must campaign against Unimelb's ties with Israeli institutions complicit in the occupation, apartheid and genocide in Palestine, such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which is directly involved in Israel‚Äôs genocide by training IDF soldiers and officers.
<br><br>
2. That the UMSU Students' Council exercise its powers to campaign against the repression of pro-Palestine protest. This includes a campaign demanding the university rescind both the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition and the Universities Australia (UA) definition of antisemitism, adopted in February by all public Australian universities. These definitions work to silence opposition on campus to Israel's crimes by conflating pro-Palestine protests as antisemitic. The Students' Council must be clear that there is nothing antisemitic about calling for the end of an apartheid state that is committing genocide. Additionally, the Students' Council must demand that the UniMelb Chancellory rescind the 3 March 2025 Vice-Chancellor Rules (indoor protest ban) and 16 May 2024 Vice-Chancellor Rules which punish students for legitimate protest. Lastly, exercising Students' Council power in a campaign to rescind the suspensions and expulsions of the 4 students for their legitimate protest against ties to the apartheid Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Semester 2 2024.
<br><br>
3. That the UMSU Students' Council exercise its powers to affirm the right of Palestinians to resist their occupation, in accordance with International Law. The violence in Palestine and Israel is a result of the Israeli state, its occupation of Palestine, and the apartheid system imposed on Palestinians. 
<br><br>
4. That the UMSU Students' Council endorse a single, secular, democratic state across all of historic Palestine, from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea. This would be a single state where people of all faiths and backgrounds live in freedom and equality, as opposed to an apartheid state committed to genocide and ethnic cleansing.

The motions must be heard. 

To the General Secretary of the University of Melbourne Student Union (UMSU). We, the undersigned students, demand that a Special General Meeting (SGM) be called to vote on the following resolutions:

1. That the UMSU Students' Council exercise its powers to campaign against Unimelb's complicity in the genocidal onslaught in Gaza, including against Unimelb's research partnership with Lockheed Martin, and all weapons manufacturers who arm Israel‚Äôs genocide. These weapons companies profit from selling weapons to the Israeli Occupation Forces - who commit war crimes against Palestinians.
